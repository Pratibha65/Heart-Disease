# Heart-Disease

In this project, I developed a heart disease prediction model using logistic regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm using Python.
The primary objective of this project was to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on these features.
The data was split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio, and the logistic regression model was trained on the training data.
This project involves analysis and building of a predictive model using Logistic Regression to estimate the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic.

The dataset used for this project is derived from the famous Titanic dataset available on Kaggle, which includes details about the passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and other relevant features.
Used various Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
